All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- `config/internal-links.php` — global configuration file with `blog_collection` and `admin_site` keys
- `InstallCommand` auto-detects blog collection by scanning collection handles for keywords (`blog`, `post`, `article`, `news`, `journal`, `entry`)
- On multisite installs, `InstallCommand` asks which site is used to manage content in the CP
- Detected values are written automatically into the published config file
- `vendor:publish --tag=internal-links-config` for config-only publish

### Changed
- `blog_collection` moved from a per-entry CP field to a global config key — set once, applies everywhere
- `admin_site` replaces the hardcoded `'pl'` in the modifier query — now read from config
- Blueprint simplified: `blog_collection` field removed from CP
- Composer package renamed to `5k18a/blog-internal-links`
- CP blueprint and collection labels translated to English for Statamic Marketplace compatibility

### Removed
- `blog_collection` entries picker field from blueprint (replaced by config)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Antlers modifier `apply_internal_links` for automatic keyword substitution in HTML/Bard content
- `LinkableContentParser` — HTML-aware keyword replacer that protects headings, existing links, images, figures, iframes, and WordPress embed comments from substitution
- `internal_links` Statamic collection with blueprint for managing keyword → entry mappings
- Per-locale keyword support: each keyword in the replicator has an optional `locale` field; empty = all languages, set = specific language only
- Target entry URL resolves automatically to the correct language version via Statamic's native multisite URL resolution (`Entry::in($site)`)
- Deduplication: each target URL is linked at most once per page request
- `php artisan internal-links:install` command — creates collection YAML, publishes blueprint, refreshes stache
- `vendor:publish --tag=internal-links-blueprints` for blueprint-only publish
- `vendor:publish --tag=internal-links-collection` for collection-only publish
- Blueprint fields: `target_entry`, `keywords` (replicator with `keyword` + `locale`), `weight`, `nofollow`, `open_in_new_window`, `enabled`
